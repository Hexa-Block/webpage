## Overview

Swear IT is a B2B SaaS platform designed to help organizations back their product claims with verifiable, tamper-resistant evidence.

The platform uses blockchain as a trust layer to connect real-world products with digital proof of origin, authenticity, and lifecycle information. By combining blockchain-backed records with QR-based consumer access, Swear IT enables brands to replace marketing claims with facts that can be independently verified.

As Tech Co-Founder, I led the technical architecture and evolution of the platform, taking it from initial concept through MVP, market adoption, and a successful exit.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-Backed Proof**  
  Designed a blockchain-based data layer to store and validate critical product information, ensuring claims are backed by immutable records rather than self-declared statements.

- **QR-Based Transparency**  
  Implemented a system where end users can scan a QR code on a product to access verified information about its origin and lifecycle, directly from the source of truth.


- **Smart Contract–Backed Evidence Registry**  
  Implemented smart contracts as an immutable registry to store
  verifiable records of each product-related proof, ensuring that
  every claim could be independently validated and audited over time.

- **Real-World Product Focus**  
  Built the platform around physical products and real supply chains, bridging the gap between digital systems and on-the-ground operations.

- **Production-Grade Architecture**  
  Designed and operated the system as a live, customer-facing platform, prioritizing reliability, scalability, and long-term ownership over experimentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: As a trust and verification layer for product data.
- **Smart Contracts**: Used as a tamper-resistant ledger to store verifiable proof records associated with each product.
- **QR Code Systems**: For secure, user-friendly access to verified information.
- **SaaS Architecture**: Designed to operate under real commercial and operational constraints.

(Technology choices are intentionally abstracted to emphasize system design and ownership over tooling.)

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was translating the guarantees provided by blockchain into something meaningful and accessible for non-technical users. The system needed to be technically robust while remaining simple to understand and use.

Another challenge was operating a blockchain-based system in real-world environments, where data originates outside the system and trust must be established at the edges. This reinforced the importance of clear system boundaries, ownership, and operational discipline.

## Outcome

Swear IT operated as a production B2B platform, enabling organizations to replace unverified claims with provable, blockchain-backed facts. The company completed its full lifecycle, from inception to market adoption, culminating in a successful exit.

This project represents hands-on experience designing, operating, and owning blockchain systems that interact directly with real-world products and users.
